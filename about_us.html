        <h1 id="head"> <br><br><br><br><br><br>A brief History</h1>
        <p id="p1">
            Founded in 1976, <b>Jahazing</b> was one of the most elite, luxurious, transcontinental airlines of all time. A group of 4 individuals carved their rough idea into a reality by launching their first flight from <b>Lahore(Pakistan)</b> to <b>Munich (Germany)</b> on <b>6<sup id="superscript"><b>th</b></sup> November 1976</b>. 
            <br>
            Many organisations have signed us as their travel partner. The Cricket World Cup winning team of <b>Australia</b> in 1987 travelled back to Australia from <b>Kolkata(India)</b> with our airlines. The famous Indian Tycoon <b>Dhirubhai Ambani</b>, founder of Reliance and the father of one of the Asia's richest men <b>Mukesh Ambani</b>, have travelled to Europe numerously with our airline.
            <br>
            Having their Head Office in <b>Karachi(Pakistan)</b>, Jahazing is operating 110 global offices to serve and facilitate their passengers, and to ensure the safe, comfortable journey of their valuable customers.

        <h1 id="head">A word from our Head of Crew Cabin and Stewards</h1>
        <p id="p1">
            Some airlines have problems with flight schedules, while some of them are serving sub-standard food, but always be rest assured when travelling with Jahazing. There will never be any sort of unnecessary delays and I assure you that food quality is up to the mark and you will find anything and everything you wish to eat. I highly doubt that you will never find service anywhere else in any other airline.
            <br>
            It was always my dream to fly in the sky and to float in the air, because sky is the limit. As an ex-pilot, I can tell you it is very intimidating to fly this great machinery thousands of metres above in the sky, but it is always an adventure being airborne.
            <br>
            I welcome all the upcoming passengers on board and wish them a very good luck on their first ever flight with Jahazing, and you will surely love the journey."
